# LibraryManagementSystem22The MyLibrary Desktop Application is a C# WinForms project designed to manage a small library's book inventory and member borrowing records. This application demonstrates key concepts of event-driven programming, UI design, and robust database connectivity using ADO.NET. Its core functionality includes a secure login form that authenticates users against a Users table in the database, opening the main application window upon success or displaying an error upon failure. From the main window, users can navigate to dedicated sections for Book Management and Borrower Management, with a convenient "Logout" button to return to the login screen.

Within the Book Management section, a DataGridView displays all books, including their ID, Title, Author, Publication Year, Available Copies, and Total Copies. Users can perform various operations such as adding new books by entering details in a dedicated form, editing existing book records by selecting a row and pre-populating a form for modification, and deleting selected books after a confirmation prompt. The system also supports searching for books by title or author and includes a refresh button to reload the full list. Similarly, the Borrower Management section features a DataGridView listing all borrowers with their ID, Name, Email, and Phone. Here, users can add new borrowers, edit existing ones by selecting a row, and delete borrowers after confirmation. Search functionality is available for finding borrowers by name or email, alongside a refresh option. Both management sections include a "Back" button for seamless navigation back to the main window.

Technically, the application is built with C# on the .NET Framework using WinForms for the user interface. It relies on a SQL Server database, which can be either a full instance or a local SQL Server LocalDB file (.mdf). Data access is handled through ADO.NET, employing parameterized queries to enhance security. The application extensively utilizes event handlers for UI controls, such as button clicks, form loads, text changes, and key presses, to ensure a responsive user experience. Comprehensive try-catch blocks are implemented around all database calls to gracefully manage exceptions and display user-friendly error messages. Basic input validation is also in place to prevent common data entry errors, such as ensuring text boxes are not empty, enforcing numeric ranges, and validating email formats. The navigation scheme is designed for user convenience, with forms hiding and showing as users move between sections, complemented by back buttons for easy return paths.

To set up the database, one can either execute the provided SQL script in SQL Server Management Studio for an existing SQL Server instance (ensuring the MyLibrary database is created and populated with Users, Books, Borrowers, and IssuedBooks tables, including an admin user with password 1234), or create a MyLibraryDB.mdf file directly within Visual Studio's Solution Explorer and run the script against it (omitting the USE [MyLibrary]; line). After database setup, the App.config file must be updated with the correct connectionString pointing to the database, replacing placeholders like YOUR_SERVER_NAME or using the connection string from the .mdf file's properties. Building and running the application involves adding a reference to System.Configuration in the project's references, ensuring consistent MyLibraryApp namespaces across all .cs and .Designer.cs files, performing a clean and rebuild of the solution, and then running the application (e.g., by pressing F5). Upon launch, the Login Form will appear, ready for authentication with the default credentials: Username admin and Password 1234. Future enhancements might include a dedicated section for UI screenshots in a /docs/screenshots/ folder within the repository.
